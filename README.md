Content: 

- A generator matrix G_104_52_18 of an optimal binary self-dual code of length 104 used in *Decoding of the [104,52,18] Self-dual Code*.

- A set of weight 18 codewords in the code generated by G_104_52_18 in file Codewords_wt_18_from_104_52_18.txt.

- A generator matrix G_1064_532_nonsys of a binary [1064, 532, d &ge; 162] code constructed in *A Binary [1064, 532, d &ge; 162] Self-dual Code*.
  The matrix G_1064_532_sys is a generator matrix in systematic form of the same code.
